# Data Engineering
Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. The key to understanding what data engineering lies in the “engineering” part.  Engineers design and build things. “Data” engineers design and build pipelines that transform and transport data into a format wherein, by the time it reaches the Data Scientists or other end users, it is in a highly usable state.  These pipelines must take data from many disparate sources and collect them into a single warehouse that represents the data uniformly as a single source of truth.
